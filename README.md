# KaniwaDojo

This project allows for the user to select from a wide range of required gear when attending a martial arts school, and has a complete mock checkout process. (Be sure to put in 4242424242424242 for the card/exp/zipcode information)

### Developer Notes

Working on this project helped me grow as a junior developer. Utilizing the various libraries for styling and commerce.js for storing data proved a great experience driven project for growth. (I'm constantly making style changes as I learn better approaches).
Currently the categories selectors at the top need some adjustments to work properly, though their hover states should still be visible.
